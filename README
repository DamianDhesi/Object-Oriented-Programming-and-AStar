Implementation of AStar and Object Oriented Design by Damian Dhesi

This program was given as a project for a Java class where we were assigned the goal of taking a 
large file base and redesigning it to be in an Object Oriented format. The program is a sort of mini
game where a bunch of lumber jacks run around cutting down trees as faires touch the stumps to cause 
the trees to regrow after being cut down.  In addition to reformatting the code, we were tasked
with creating an AStar pathing algorithm for the lumber jacks and faries. 

The file base orignially started with nearly all functions in a file called Functions and there was 
no use of interfaces or abstract classes. Over the course of the class, I redesigned the files to
follow a more Object Oriented desgin by moving the functions into their respective classes and added
interfaces and abstract classes as needed. This progression is detailed in DESIGN where I give a 
short description of why each function is in each class. Addtionally, the uml folder holds flow 
charts that show the progression of the code base towards a more Object Oriented design as I made 
changes. 

After reformatting the code, I also implemented an AStar pathing strategy to allow the lumber jacks
and fairies to move in a more intelligent manor compared to their single step pathing strategy. Both
strategies can be viewed in the src folder.
